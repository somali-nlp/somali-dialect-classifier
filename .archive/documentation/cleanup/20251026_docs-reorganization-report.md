## 1. Files Archived

### Archive Location

`.archive/2025-10-26-docs-cleanup/`

### Archived Items

#### A. Investigation Documents (Internal)

**Directory**: `docs/investigations/2025-10-26-quality-stats/` → `.archive/2025-10-26-docs-cleanup/investigations/`

**Files Archived**:
1. `README.md` - Investigation summary
2. `QUALITY_STATS_FIX_VERIFICATION.md` - Verification report with production data
3. `QUALITY_STATS_TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS.md` - Deep-dive technical analysis

**Justification**:
- **Internal-only content**: Investigation artifacts documenting a bug report that concluded no bug existed
- **Not user-facing**: These documents tracked an internal debugging process, not end-user guidance
- **Historical value only**: Useful for maintainers to understand past investigations, but not relevant to users

**Key Finding Documented**: Feature working correctly. Field renamed from `quality_stats` to `text_length_stats`.

#### B. Migration Guide (Internal Process Documentation)

**File**: `docs/guides/metrics-migration.md` → `.archive/2025-10-26-docs-cleanup/metrics-migration.md`

**Size**: 415 lines

**Justification**:
- **Process documentation**: Described an internal Phase 1 refactoring migration timeline
- **Temporary relevance**: Deprecation warnings and backward compatibility notes no longer needed
- **User content extracted**: All user-facing metric information integrated into permanent reference docs

**Content Disposition**:
- ✅ **Preserved**: Metric tables, descriptions, examples, best practices → `docs/reference/metrics.md`
- ❌ **Archived**: Migration timeline, deprecation warnings, bug fixes, internal implementation notes

---

## 2. Files Created

### New Reference Document

**File**: `docs/reference/metrics.md`

**Size**: 380 lines

**Purpose**: Comprehensive reference for pipeline metrics collection, reporting, and interpretation

**Content**:

1. **Pipeline-Specific Metrics**
   - Web Scraping (BBC): `http_request_success_rate`, `content_extraction_success_rate`
   - File Processing (Wikipedia, Språkbanken): `file_extraction_success_rate`, `record_parsing_success_rate`
   - Stream Processing (HuggingFace): `stream_connection_success_rate`, `record_retrieval_success_rate`, `dataset_coverage_rate`

2. **Common Metrics**
   - `quality_pass_rate` - Quality filter pass rate
   - `deduplication_rate` - Duplicate detection rate
   - `text_length_stats` - Text length statistics

3. **Usage Examples**
   - Programmatic access via `MetricsCollector`
   - Reading exported JSON files
   - Quality report interpretation

4. **Debugging Guidance**
   - Identifying issues from metric values
   - Setting up alerts
   - Monitoring trends over time

**Integration**: Added to `docs/index.md` under "Reference - API Documentation" section

## 3. Files Evaluated (No Changes)

### Architecture Documentation Assessment

#### docs/overview/architecture.md (650 lines)

**Focus**: Software architecture and design patterns

**Content**:
- SOLID principles application
- Design patterns (Template Method, Strategy, Pipeline, Factory, Iterator)
- Component architecture (BasePipeline, Processors, Filters, Cleaners)
- Technology stack
- Extension points

**Verdict**: ✅ **Keep as-is** - Distinct focus on software design

#### docs/overview/data-pipeline-architecture.md (1,180 lines)

**Focus**: Data flow and ETL architecture

**Content**:
- Medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold)
- Processing stages (extraction, cleaning, filtering, writing)
- Data layers and partitioning
- MLOps infrastructure (logging, metrics, deduplication, crawl ledger)
- File naming conventions and lineage tracking

**Verdict**: ✅ **Keep as-is** - Distinct focus on data architecture

**Analysis**: These documents serve **different purposes**:
- `architecture.md` = "How is the software designed?" (for developers)
- `data-pipeline-architecture.md` = "How does data flow through the system?" (for data engineers)

**No redundancy detected**.

#### docs/guides/data-pipeline.md (707 lines)

**Focus**: Practical user guide for running pipelines

**Content**:
- Running individual pipelines
- Configuration examples
- Common workflows
- Troubleshooting
- Monitoring and quality

**Verdict**: ✅ **Keep as-is** - Complements architecture docs with "how-to" focus

**Analysis**: This is a **user guide** (how to use), not architectural documentation (how it works). Serves different audience.

### Dashboard Documentation Assessment

#### docs/guides/dashboard.md (1,008 lines)

**Structure**:
1. Quick Start (5 minutes)
2. Automated Deployment
3. Dashboard Architecture
4. Local Development
5. Dashboard Features
6. Customization
7. Troubleshooting
8. Advanced Features

**Verdict**: ✅ **Keep as single document** - Well-structured with progressive disclosure

**Justification**:
- Logical flow from basics to advanced
- Each section builds on previous knowledge
- Splitting would fragment the learning path
- Size is manageable for comprehensive guide
- Table of contents provides easy navigation
