# Phase 1: Dashboard Metrics Refactoring - Quick Start

**Status:** ✅ Complete | **Date:** October 26, 2025 | **Version:** 2.0

## What Changed?

We removed the misleading "overall success rate" and prepared the dashboard for pipeline-specific metrics.

### Quick Summary

- ❌ **Removed:** Overall success rate (averaged incompatible metrics)
- ✅ **Added:** Quality pass rate (meaningful across all pipeline types)
- ✅ **Added:** Pipeline type tracking
- ✅ **Maintained:** Backward compatibility with old metrics files

## Files Modified

1. **`.github/workflows/deploy-dashboard-v2.yml`** - Metrics generation with pipeline detection
2. **`dashboard/templates/index.html`** - All visualizations updated to quality rate

## Before → After

### Dashboard Hero Stats
```
BEFORE: Success Rate (89.3%)
AFTER:  Pipeline Types (3)
```

### Charts & Tables
```
BEFORE: "Success Rate by Source"
AFTER:  "Quality Pass Rate by Source"
```

### Data Structure
```json
// BEFORE (Schema 1.0)
{"success_rate": 1.0}

// AFTER (Schema 2.0)
{
  "pipeline_metrics": {
    "quality_pass_rate": 0.7076,
    "file_extraction_rate": 1.0,
    "parsing_rate": 1.0
  }
}
```

## Why This Change?

**Problem:** The old "success rate" meant different things for each pipeline:
- Wikipedia (file processing): File extraction success = 100%
- BBC (web scraping): HTTP 200 responses = 65%
- HuggingFace (streaming): Stream connection = 85%

**Averaging these gives 83.3% - meaningless!** (Comparing apples to oranges)

**Solution:** Use "quality pass rate" which measures data quality after filtering - consistent across all pipelines.

## Backward Compatibility

✅ Old metrics files (schema 1.0) continue to work
✅ New metrics files (schema 2.0) show improved data
✅ Graceful fallback if new fields missing
✅ No breaking changes for users

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. Wait for UX designer to provide layout for per-source metric cards
2. Implement pipeline-specific metric displays:
   - **Web scraping:** HTTP success, extraction rate, quality rate
   - **File processing:** File extraction, parsing rate, quality rate
   - **Stream processing:** Connection success, retrieval rate, coverage, quality rate

## Backend Team TODO

Update metrics collection to use new field names:

```python
# Instead of generic "fetch_success_rate"
# Use pipeline-specific names:

# Web scraping:
"http_request_success_rate": 0.65
"content_extraction_success_rate": 1.0

# File processing:
"file_extraction_success_rate": 1.0
"record_parsing_success_rate": 1.0

# Stream processing:
"stream_connection_success_rate": 1.0
"record_retrieval_success_rate": 0.95
"dataset_coverage_rate": 0.95
```

Keep `fetch_success_rate` temporarily for backward compatibility.

## Quick Validation

```bash
# Check workflow syntax
python3 -c "import sys; exec(open('.github/workflows/deploy-dashboard-v2.yml').read())"

# View metrics structure (after deployment)
curl https://somali-nlp.github.io/somali-dialect-classifier/data/all_metrics.json | jq '.schema_version'

# Test dashboard locally
cd dashboard && python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

## Commit Message

```
feat(dashboard): refactor metrics to use pipeline-specific rates

- Remove misleading overall success rate
- Add pipeline-specific metric extraction
- Update visualizations to use quality pass rate
- Implement backward compatibility (schema 1.0 → 2.0)

BREAKING CHANGE: Overall success rate removed from dashboard

The old metric averaged incompatible values (HTTP success ≠ file
extraction ≠ stream connection). Quality pass rate is meaningful
across all pipeline types.

Phase 2 will add per-source cards with pipeline-specific metrics.
```

**Implementation complete!** Ready to commit and deploy.
