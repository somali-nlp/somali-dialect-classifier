## Remaining Issues & Recommendations

### Minor Nitpicks (Non-Blocking)

1. **Navigation Height**
   - Current: ~64px
   - Suggestion: Increase to 80px for closer Tableau match
   - Impact: Very minor visual refinement
   - Priority: Low

2. **Hero Button Spacing**
   - Current spacing is good
   - Could increase gap slightly (from 16px to 20px) for even more breathing room
   - Impact: Minimal
   - Priority: Low

3. **Card Hover Elevation**
   - Current lift is subtle and professional
   - Could experiment with slightly more pronounced shadow on hover
   - Impact: Enhancement, not correction
   - Priority: Low

### Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Loading States**
   - Add skeleton screens matching Tableau's loading patterns
   - Implement progressive loading indicators

2. **Micro-interactions**
   - Consider subtle animations matching Tableau's interaction design
   - Button press states could include slight scale feedback

3. **Dark Mode Support**
   - Design tokens are well-structured for future dark theme
   - Would require careful color remapping to maintain Tableau aesthetic
