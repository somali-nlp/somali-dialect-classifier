## Why These Were Archived

### Completed Objectives

All planning and design documents served their purpose:
- ✅ Design specifications implemented in production
- ✅ All visualizations enhanced and deployed
- ✅ Performance targets achieved
- ✅ Accessibility standards maintained
- ✅ Documentation consolidated into main README

### Archiving Rationale

1. **Reduce Project Root Clutter**: Keep main directory focused on active development
2. **Preserve Historical Context**: Document decision-making process for future reference
3. **Follow Best Practices**: Date-stamped archives enable easy retrieval
4. **Maintain Clean Git History**: Separate completed planning docs from active codebase
