# Metrics Analysis Script Relocation

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Action:** Moved `metrics_analysis.py` from project root to internal archive
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (local + remote)

---

## Issue Identified

File `metrics_analysis.py` was found in the project root directory, which is not the appropriate location for this type of script.

---

## Investigation Results

### File Characteristics
- **Size:** 19 KB (421 lines)
- **Purpose:** One-time analysis script for metrics refactoring validation
- **Creation:** Part of commit `2fbe54f` - "feat(metrics): refactor metrics calculation with pipeline-specific semantic names"
- **Date:** 2025-10-26

### Code Analysis
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Metrics Refactoring Analysis
Analyzes existing metrics data and validates the impact of the refactoring project.
"""
```

**Functions:**
- `load_all_metrics()` - Load metrics files by pipeline type
- `analyze_bbc_test_limit_issue()` - Analyze BBC test limit issue
- `analyze_stream_processing_metrics()` - Analyze stream processing
- `generate_backward_compatible_metrics()` - Generate compatibility examples
- `main()` - Standalone execution

### Usage Status
- ✅ Has `if __name__ == "__main__"` (standalone script)
- ❌ NOT imported by any production code (`grep` returned no results)
- ❌ NOT a library module
- ✅ Generates output files (schemas, examples)

---

## Decision: ARCHIVE

**Rationale:**
1. **One-time diagnostic tool** - Used during metrics refactoring, not ongoing
2. **Not production code** - No imports found in codebase
3. **Standalone script** - Meant to be run independently
4. **Historical value** - Useful reference for understanding refactoring decisions

**Destination:** `.archive/artifacts/scripts/`

## Actions Taken

### 1. Local Changes
```bash
# Copy to archive with proper naming
cp metrics_analysis.py .archive/artifacts/scripts/20251026_metrics-analysis.py

# Remove from git tracking
git rm metrics_analysis.py
```

### 2. Git Commit
```
commit d87a070
Author: Claude Code
Date: 2025-10-26

chore(archive): move metrics_analysis.py to internal archive

This is a one-time analysis script used during metrics refactoring.
Not imported by any production code, purely diagnostic.
Moved to .archive/artifacts/scripts/ with proper naming convention.

### 3. Remote Update
```bash
git push origin main
# Pushed to: github.com:somali-nlp/somali-dialect-classifier
```

---

## Verification

### Local
```bash
$ ls metrics_analysis.py
ls: metrics_analysis.py: No such file or directory
✓ File removed from root

$ ls -lh .archive/artifacts/scripts/20251026_metrics-analysis.py
-rw-r--r--  1 user  staff  19K 26 Oct 18:42 .archive/artifacts/scripts/20251026_metrics-analysis.py
✓ File archived with proper naming
```

### Remote
```bash
$ git log --oneline -1
d87a070 chore(archive): move metrics_analysis.py to internal archive
✓ Commit pushed to remote

$ git ls-remote origin main
424f6ae..d87a070  main -> main
✓ Remote repository updated
```

## Impact

### Before
```
project-root/
├── metrics_analysis.py    ← Misplaced in root
├── src/
├── tests/
└── ...
```

### After
```
project-root/
├── src/
├── tests/
└── .archive/
    └── artifacts/
        └── scripts/
            └── 20251026_metrics-analysis.py  ← Properly archived
```

---

## Related Files

The script generated several output files that were also properly archived:
- `all_metrics_schema_v2.json` → `.archive/artifacts/prototypes/`
- `backward_compat_example_*.json` → `.archive/artifacts/prototypes/`

These files were already relocated in the dated subdirectories migration.

---

## Future Considerations

### If Similar Scripts Are Found
1. **Check usage:** `grep -r "script_name" src/`
2. **Check git history:** `git log --all -- script_name.py`
3. **Decision criteria:**
   - If imported by production code → Keep in appropriate module
   - If one-time diagnostic → Archive to `.archive/artifacts/scripts/`
   - If test utility → Move to `tests/`
   - If deployment script → Move to `scripts/` or `.archive/deployments/`

### Naming Convention
When archiving scripts:
- Format: `YYYYMMDD_descriptive-name.py`
- Use date from git commit or file modification
- Use kebab-case for descriptive label

---

## Summary

✅ **File relocated:** Root → `.archive/artifacts/scripts/`
✅ **Naming applied:** `metrics_analysis.py` → `20251026_metrics-analysis.py`
✅ **Git cleaned:** Removed from repository
✅ **Remote updated:** Changes pushed to GitHub
✅ **Documentation:** This report created

**Status:** COMPLETE

The project root is now cleaner, and the script is properly archived with other diagnostic tools from the metrics refactoring phase.
