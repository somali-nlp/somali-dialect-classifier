# Quality Stats Investigation - 2025-10-26

## Summary

Investigation into reported issue where pipeline metrics showed `"quality_stats": null` instead of calculated statistics.

## Result

✅ **RESOLVED - No Bug Found**

The feature is working correctly. The field was renamed from `quality_stats` to `text_length_stats` and all calculations are functioning properly.

## Key Findings

1. **Data Collection**: ✅ Text lengths are being recorded correctly
2. **Calculations**: ✅ All statistics (min, max, mean, median, total_chars) are accurate
3. **Export**: ✅ JSON files contain properly formatted data
4. **All Pipeline Types**: ✅ Working for web_scraping, file_processing, and stream_processing

## Verification Evidence

- Examined production metrics from BBC Somali, HuggingFace, and Wikipedia pipelines
- All show populated `text_lengths` arrays with correctly calculated `text_length_stats`
- Unit tests confirm mathematical accuracy

## Documents

1. **QUALITY_STATS_FIX_VERIFICATION.md** - Comprehensive verification report with real data examples
2. **QUALITY_STATS_TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS.md** - Deep-dive technical analysis of the implementation

## Code Location

- Implementation: `/src/somali_dialect_classifier/utils/metrics.py`
- Lines: 220-228 (calculation), 316-318 (collection)

## Action Items

- ✅ Verified feature is working correctly
- ✅ Documented implementation details
- ✅ Confirmed all pipeline types are supported
- ℹ️ Consider updating any docs that reference old `quality_stats` name to use `text_length_stats`

## Conclusion

No code changes required. The quality statistics feature is fully functional and production-ready.
