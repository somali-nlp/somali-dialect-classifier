---

## Agents Coordinated

### 1. Documentation Writer Agent ✅
**Task:** Review all dashboard documentation for completeness and accuracy
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Key Findings:**
- Documentation is well-structured with 3 tiers (Quick Start, Setup Guide, Summary)
- **CRITICAL:** somali-nlp placeholders need updating in 5 locations
- Platform-specific commands (macOS sed) need Linux alternatives
- Overall grade: B+ (Very Good with Room for Improvement)

### 2. Data Analyst Agent ✅
**Task:** Analyze metrics data and suggest dashboard improvements
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Key Findings:**
- Total records analyzed: 13,395 across 4 sources
- **CRITICAL:** Deduplication not functioning (shows 0% across all sources)
- Created 5 analysis deliverables in `/data/analysis/`
- Recommended 10 new dashboard visualizations

### 3. Code Reviewer Agent ✅
**Task:** Review dashboard code quality and best practices
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Key Findings:**
- Overall code quality: Good foundation with areas needing attention
- **CRITICAL:** Missing file encoding (UTF-8) specifications
- **CRITICAL:** Insufficient error handling (broad exception catching)
- Identified 15+ specific improvements with priority levels

### 4. Test Runner Agent ✅
**Task:** Test dashboard functionality and verify readiness
**Status:** COMPLETE
**Key Findings:**
- 8 tests run, 100% passed locally
- **CRITICAL BUG FOUND:** GitHub workflow file pattern mismatch (`*_metrics.json` vs `*.json`)
- All dependencies verified working
- Confidence: 90% for local, 60% for deployment (before fix)

## Critical Issues Identified & Fixed

### Issue #1: GitHub Workflow File Pattern Bug ✅ FIXED
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Blocks deployment
**Location:** [.github/workflows/deploy-dashboard.yml:240](.github/workflows/deploy-dashboard.yml#L240)
**Problem:** Workflow used `glob("*_metrics.json")` but actual files are named `*_processing.json`, `*_extraction.json`, etc.
**Impact:** Would result in 0 metrics found on GitHub Pages deployment
**Fix Applied:** Changed pattern to `glob("*.json")` to match export script
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Issue #2: somali-nlp Placeholders ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED
**Severity:** HIGH - Blocks deployment
**Locations:**
- [README.md:9](README.md#L9) - Dashboard badge URL
- [README.md:13](README.md#L13) - Dashboard link
- [dashboard/README.md:7](dashboard/README.md#L7) - GitHub Pages URL
- [dashboard/app.py:405](dashboard/app.py#L405) - GitHub repository link
- [.github/workflows/deploy-dashboard.yml:144](.github/workflows/deploy-dashboard.yml#L144) - HTML link

**Action Required:** Replace somali-nlp with actual GitHub username before deployment

**Quick Fix Command:**
```bash
# macOS:
sed -i '' 's/somali-nlp/your-github-username/g' README.md dashboard/README.md dashboard/app.py .github/workflows/deploy-dashboard.yml

# Linux:
sed -i 's/somali-nlp/your-github-username/g' README.md dashboard/README.md dashboard/app.py .github/workflows/deploy-dashboard.yml
```

### Issue #3: Deduplication Tracking Bug ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Data quality issue
**Location:** Pipeline metrics collection
**Problem:** All sources show 0% deduplication rate
**Impact:** Cannot track duplicate records, unknown data quality
**Status:** Identified but not fixed (requires pipeline code changes)
