## The Linguistic Comment Reality

### Key Discovery: 67% Emoji-Only Loss

**Verified with 1,111 comment dataset:**

```
Apify Scrapes: 1,000 comments → $1.00 charged
     ↓
Raw JSONL: 1,000 items saved (100% - audit trail)
     ↓
Linguistic Filter (removes emoji-only, <3 chars text)
     ↓
Staging JSONL: ~330 linguistic comments (33%)
     ↓
Processing (minimal whitespace cleaning)
     ↓
Silver Parquet: ~271 comments (82% of linguistic)
```

**Real-World Test Results:**

| Stage | Count | Percentage |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Scraped (charged) | 1,111 | 100% |
| Linguistic | 368 | 33.1% |
| Final silver | 303 | 27.3% (82.3% of linguistic) |
| **Cost** | **$1.11** | **Effective: $3.67/1k linguistic** |

### What Counts as "Linguistic"?

Comments filtered at transform stage:

```python
# Filtered:
- Empty text → skip
- Emoji-only (no alphanumeric after removing symbols) → skip
- Too short (<3 characters of actual text) → skip

# Kept:
- Any comment with ≥3 characters of Somali/English text
- Mixed emoji + text (text extracted)
- Code-switching (Somali + English/Arabic)
```

### Why This Matters

- **Budget calculations** must account for 67% emoji-only loss
- **30k linguistic comments** require 91k total scraped
- **Original estimates** assumed 100% usable → now only 33% usable
- **Effective cost** is 3x higher than raw scraping cost

## Why You Can't Avoid Emoji-Only Comments

**Q: Can I configure Apify to skip emoji-only comments?**

**A: No - This is impossible with current technology.**

The Apify TikTok Comments Scraper has only **3 input parameters**:

```python
actor_input = {
    "postURLs": [list_of_video_urls],        # Which videos to scrape
    "commentsPerPost": 100000,                # Max number per video
    "proxy": {"useApifyProxy": True}          # Proxy settings
}
```

**NO content filtering options exist:**
- ❌ No emoji detection/filtering
- ❌ No text length filters
- ❌ No language detection
- ❌ No quality filters
- ❌ No content-based filtering of any kind

**Why this limitation exists:**

1. **TikTok API design** - Comment text is not exposed before downloading
2. **Apify billing model** - You're charged when a comment is scraped, not when you keep it
3. **Platform constraints** - No way to "peek" at comment content without downloading it fully

**This means:**
- You MUST pay for all comments Apify scrapes (including 67% emoji-only)
- Content filtering happens AFTER downloading (in your local code)
- This is a **fundamental platform limitation**, not a configuration issue

**Your options:**

1. ✅ **Accept the reality** (Recommended)
   - Budget for $3.03 per 1,000 linguistic comments
   - Filter locally after download
   - Keep all raw data for audit trail

2. ✅ **Strategic video selection**
   - Choose news/educational content (40-45% linguistic yield)
   - Avoid music/entertainment videos (20-30% linguistic yield)
   - Slightly improves ratio but doesn't eliminate cost

3. ❌ **Build custom scraper**
   - Violates TikTok Terms of Service
   - High development and maintenance cost
   - Legal risks and IP bans
   - NOT recommended

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Smart Video Selection

**Maximize linguistic yield through strategic video selection:**

**High-yield videos (40-45% linguistic):**
- News and current events
- Educational content
- Political discussions
- Cultural topics

**Low-yield videos (20-30% linguistic):**
- Music and dance videos
- Comedy/memes
- Entertainment content
- Viral trends

**Pre-filtering checklist:**
- ✅ Check visible comment count (150+ minimum)
- ✅ Verify Somali language in visible comments
- ✅ Prioritize 150-400 comment range (good ROI)
- ✅ Include some viral videos (500+) for diversity
- ✅ Mix topics and creators for dialect diversity

**Impact:**
- Potentially improve to 40% linguistic yield
- Better quality per dollar
- More diverse Somali usage patterns

### 2. Avoid Re-scraping

**Implement proper deduplication:**

```bash
# Check ledger before scraping
python -c "
from somali_dialect_classifier.preprocessing.tiktok_somali_processor import TikTokSomaliProcessor
processor = TikTokSomaliProcessor(...)
# Processor automatically checks ledger for duplicates
"
```

**Impact:**
- Prevent duplicate charges
- Maximize dataset diversity
- Critical for staying within budget

### 3. Batch Video Lists

**Combine videos into single runs:**

```python
# Instead of multiple small runs
# 5 runs × 27 videos = overhead + complexity

# Do one large batch
# 1 run × 135 videos = efficient + simple
processor.run(video_urls=all_135_videos)
```

**Impact:**
- Reduced API calls
- Simpler tracking
- Potentially lower overhead

### 4. Set Realistic Expectations

**Use verified averages:**
- Actual average: **222 comments/video** (verified by test)
- Plan for 150-300 comment range
- Don't expect viral levels from every video

**Impact:**
- Accurate budget planning
- No surprises in final cost
- Realistic dataset targets

## Cost Monitoring

### Real-Time Monitoring

**1. Apify Console Dashboard:**
- URL: https://console.apify.com/account/usage
- Track: Results scraped, cost accrued
- Alerts: Set at 80% of budget

**2. Ledger Tracking:**
```bash
# Count unique URLs fetched
grep -c "^" data/ledger/tiktok-*.ledger

# Estimate cost from ledger
python -c "
import glob
count = sum(1 for f in glob.glob('data/ledger/tiktok-*.ledger') for _ in open(f))
print(f'Comments: {count}, Cost: \${count/1000:.2f}')
"
```

**3. Pre-Run Validation:**
```python
# Before running large batch
estimated_comments = len(video_urls) * 222  # avg per video
estimated_cost = estimated_comments / 1000
print(f"Estimated cost: ${estimated_cost:.2f}")

# Confirm budget
if estimated_cost > remaining_budget:
    print("WARNING: Exceeds budget!")
```

### Post-Run Analysis

**Check metrics:**

```bash
# View extraction metrics
cat data/metrics/*tiktok*extraction.json | jq '.layered_metrics.extraction'

# Calculate actual cost
python -c "
import json
with open('data/metrics/tiktok_extraction.json') as f:
    metrics = json.load(f)
    comments = metrics['layered_metrics']['extraction']['urls_fetched']
    cost = comments / 1000
    print(f'Actual: {comments} comments = \${cost:.2f}')
"
```
