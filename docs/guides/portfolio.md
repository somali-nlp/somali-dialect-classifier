#### Technical Deep-Dive Post

```
How I built a zero-cost monitoring dashboard for my data pipeline üìä

The Challenge:
I needed to monitor data quality across 4 sources (Wikipedia, BBC, HuggingFace, Spr√•kbanken)
without spending on cloud infrastructure.

The Solution:
Built a dual-dashboard system:
1. Static dashboard on GitHub Pages (free, public)
2. Interactive Streamlit dashboard (local, full features)

Technical Implementation:
‚úÖ Metrics exported as JSON (committed to repo)
‚úÖ GitHub Actions aggregates metrics on every push
‚úÖ Streamlit renders interactive charts locally
‚úÖ Plotly for time series, heatmaps, comparisons

Key Metrics Tracked:
- Success rates (99.5% average)
- Throughput (URLs/sec, records/min)
- Deduplication rates (15% duplicates detected)
- P95 latency per source
- Filter rejection statistics

The Result:
$0/month hosting cost + professional portfolio piece

#### Lesson Learned Post

```
3 lessons I learned building a production data pipeline üßµ

1Ô∏è‚É£ Start with data quality, not just quantity
I initially focused on collecting massive datasets. Big mistake.
After implementing a pluggable filter framework with 4 quality checks,
I reduced my dataset by 20% but increased model performance by 15%.

Takeaway: Build quality filters early. They're easier to add before
you have millions of records.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Structured logging pays off 100x
I spent 2 days adding JSON structured logging with context injection.
Seemed like overhead at first. But when debugging production issues,
being able to filter logs by source, run_id, and phase saved me hours.

Takeaway: Invest in observability infrastructure upfront. Your future
self will thank you.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Documentation is a feature, not an afterthought
I wrote 10,000+ lines of documentation (guides, API reference, ADRs).
It felt slow initially. But when returning to the project after 2 weeks,
I could onboard back in minutes instead of hours.

Takeaway: Document your "why" decisions, not just your "what" code.
ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) are game-changers.

## Conference Talks

### Talk Proposal Template

**Title**: "From Zero to Production: Building a Data Quality Pipeline for Low-Resource NLP"

**Abstract** (300 words):

```
How do you build a production-grade data pipeline for a low-resource language when you don't have
existing datasets, established tooling, or a big budget?

In this talk, I'll share lessons from building the Somali Dialect Classifier‚Äîa comprehensive data
engineering project that collects, processes, and monitors 130K+ texts from 4 diverse sources.

You'll learn:
- Designing ETL pipelines with medallion architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
- Implementing automated data quality checks with pluggable filters
- Building zero-cost monitoring dashboards with Streamlit and GitHub Pages
- Optimizing memory usage for large file processing (2GB+ XML dumps)
- Setting up CI/CD for automated testing and deployment

Key Takeaways:
1. Data quality matters more than quantity‚Äî15% of collected data was duplicates
2. Structured logging pays dividends when debugging production issues
3. You can build professional monitoring without cloud infrastructure costs
4. Good documentation is a competitive advantage, not overhead
5. Testing and observability should be first-class concerns, not afterthoughts

The project demonstrates production software engineering practices including SOLID principles,
design patterns (Factory, Template Method, Strategy), comprehensive testing (165+ tests), and
extensive documentation (10,000+ lines).

All code is open source and available on GitHub. Attendees will leave with practical strategies
for building reliable data pipelines on a budget.
