# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors to the Somali Dialect Classifier project, regardless of background or identity.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community and the project
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including the repository, issue tracker, pull requests, and any other forums created by the project team for community discussion.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting the project maintainers directly. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from best practices in open source communities, tailored for the Somali Dialect Classifier project.
