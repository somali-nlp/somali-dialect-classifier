# GitHub Pages Configuration Guide

**Issue:** You're seeing the old-style Pages configuration (Jekyll or Static HTML)
**Solution:** Switch to GitHub Actions deployment method

---

## 🎯 Correct Configuration

Based on your screenshot, here's what you need to do:

### Option 1: Use GitHub Actions (RECOMMENDED - What our workflow expects)

1. **Look for a "Source" dropdown** at the top of the GitHub Pages settings

2. **You should see options like:**
   - Deploy from a branch
   - GitHub Actions

3. **Select: "GitHub Actions"**

4. **Save the settings**

---

### Option 2: If You Only See "Deploy from a branch" Option

If GitHub Pages settings only shows "Deploy from a branch" with Jekyll/Static HTML options:

#### Configure it this way:

1. **Source:** Deploy from a branch
2. **Branch:** Select **`gh-pages`** (if it exists) OR **`main`**
3. **Folder:** Select **`/ (root)`** OR **`/_site`** if that option exists
4. **Theme/Custom domain:** Leave as default

However, this means you need to update the workflow to work with branch deployment instead of GitHub Actions deployment.

---

## 🔧 Solution A: Enable GitHub Actions Deployment (BEST)

If your GitHub Pages settings look like this:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Build and deployment                            │
│                                                 │
│ Source                                          │
│ ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐       │
│ │ Deploy from a branch              ▼  │       │
│ └──────────────────────────────────────┘       │
│                                                 │
│ OR                                              │
│                                                 │
│ ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐       │
│ │ GitHub Actions                    ▼  │       │
│ └──────────────────────────────────────┘       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Select:** GitHub Actions

Then our workflow will automatically deploy the dashboard!

---

## 🔧 Solution B: Use Branch Deployment (ALTERNATIVE)

If GitHub Actions isn't available as an option, configure it this way:

### Step 1: Configure Pages for Branch Deployment

1. **Source:** Deploy from a branch
2. **Branch:** `main`
3. **Folder:** `/ (root)`
4. **Save**

### Step 2: Update the Workflow

We need to modify the workflow to push to `gh-pages` branch instead:

```bash
# Let me update the workflow for you
```

Would you like me to update the workflow to support branch deployment?

---

## 🔧 Solution C: Simple Static HTML (QUICKEST)

If you want the dashboard live **immediately** without workflows:

### Step 1: Create a simple index.html

I can create a simple static HTML page that loads your dashboard data and displays it.

### Step 2: Configure Pages

1. **Source:** Deploy from a branch
2. **Branch:** `main`
3. **Folder:** `/` (root) or `/docs` if you prefer
4. Save

## 📸 What Does Your Settings Page Look Like?

Please confirm what you see in your GitHub Pages settings:

### Scenario A: Modern Interface
```
Source: [Dropdown with "Deploy from a branch" and "GitHub Actions"]
```
→ **Choose:** GitHub Actions

### Scenario B: Classic Interface
```
Source: [Only "Deploy from a branch"]
Branch: [Dropdown]
Folder: [Dropdown]
Theme Chooser: [Jekyll themes]
```
→ **Choose:** main branch, / (root) folder
→ **Then:** I'll update the workflow OR create static HTML

### Scenario C: Organization Restrictions
```
"GitHub Pages is disabled for this repository"
"Contact your organization admin"
```
→ **Need:** Organization admin to enable Pages

## ⚡ Quick Decision Tree

**Q1: Can you see "GitHub Actions" as a Source option?**
- ✅ YES → Select it, save, done! Dashboard will deploy automatically
- ❌ NO → Continue to Q2

**Q2: Can you select a branch (like "main" or "gh-pages")?**
- ✅ YES → I'll create a static HTML version for you (quick!)
- ❌ NO → You need admin permissions or Pages needs to be enabled

---

## 🎯 My Recommendation

Based on the two options you mentioned (Jekyll or Static HTML):

### **Choose: Static HTML**

Here's why:
1. **No build process needed** (Jekyll has build times)
2. **Works with our _site/ directory** structure
3. **Faster deployment**

### Configuration:
```
Source: Deploy from a branch
Branch: main
Folder: /_site (if available) or / (root)
Theme: None needed
```

Then, I'll create an `index.html` at the root that redirects to `_site/index.html`.
